# ChatGPR
An AI-Powered Thesis/Research Assistant for University Students

### ChatGPR assists students with:
1. **Source Collection** based on your research topic: creating a detailed research report w/ APA
2. **AI Second Brain** An AI powered database using your collected literature and knowledge: Based on RAG w/ Knowledge Graphs 

### Future Ideas:
1. **UI:** A user-friendly web application as a frontend (replacing the code terminal)
2. **Local LLMs:** Currently the project will be powered by APIs from big companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Later on I want to offer a free, local way to power the app.
3. **Subtopic Exploration** based on research topic and personal/academic interests (list of potential subtopics with(out) sources
4. **AI Supervisor** that is available for questions, advice and to help you think through issues: Based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy methodology and literature

### Ending note
This will be a long-term project, but I am super excited to build this out over time, hoping to have a MVP asap, and a more flushed out version by the end of 2024.
